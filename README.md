# üçéüå≥ FruitTreeUnityMinigame

A Unity scene showcasing a custom 2D physics system with a focus on satisfying game feel through physics-based movement, inverse kinematics, and playful sound effects.

Unity Version: 2022.3.62f1

## ‚ú® Features
**Inverse Kinematics Tree Trunk**
An elastic, cartoon-style tree trunk using a simple IK system to simulate bending and squash/stretch behavior.

**Custom Rigidbody System**
A lightweight physics system with support for velocity, torque, and toggling gravity ‚Äî designed for more control than Unity's built-in rigidbodies.

**Spring Physics Controller**
A custom spring class simulates spring-like behavior by tethering objects to a target point, adding a dynamic feel when dragging or releasing them.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls
Click and hold on an apple to grab it.

Drag the apple away from the tree to detach it.

Drop the apple on the goal area to score.

Repeat and enjoy the satisfying motion!
